When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.<br><br><strong>What do we use your information for?</strong><br>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience, improve our website, improve customer service, process transactions, send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order.

We offer the use of a secure server.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.<br><br><strong>Payments and refunds</strong><br>The Site offers products and services for sale. The Site does not handle payments for these products directly but rather refers these payments to a secure third-party payment processor which handles all aspects of the payment process. Any payment issues or disputes should be resolved directly with the payment processor. Once we have been notified by the payment processor that a payment has been made, and that the payment has successfully passed a fraud review, access will be granted to the product or service being purchased as soon as possible, however, we make no guarantees of timeliness or immediacy. Free accounts are provided with a limited access to the Site that allows the user to test all available services prior to making a payment and determine if the offered services meet users needs. You may request a refund within 7 days of the payment only if your browser does not support javascript and you're not able to use our policy generator, otherwise, no refunds will be offered. Note that our system keeps track of your browser name, version and javascript support so we will verify each request for legitimacy.<br><br><strong>Responsibility of website visitors</strong><br>By operating the Site, the Operator does not represent or imply that it endorses any or all of the contributed content, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful.

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.<br><br><strong>Copyright infringement and policy</strong><br>As the Operator asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.
